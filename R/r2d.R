#' R-squared as Deviance Explained
#'
#' \code{r2d} calculates R-squared as the fraction of deviance explained, which
#' equals traditional R-squared (fraction of variance explained) for linear
#' regression models, but, unlike traditional R-squared, generalizes to
#' exponential family regression models. With optional additional arguments,
#' \code{r2d} can also returns a predictive R-squared for how well the model
#' predicts responses for new observations and/or a cross-validated R-squared
#' with a bootstrapped confidence interval.
#'
#' For standard linear regression models fit with \code{\link[stats]{lm}}, the
#' familiar coefficient of determination, R-squared, can be obtained with
#' \code{\link[stats]{summary.lm}}. However, R-squared is not provided for
#' generalized linear models (GLMs) fit with \code{\link[stats]{glm}},
#' presumably because it can have undesirable properties when applied to GLMs
#' with non-normal error distributions (e.g., binomial, Poisson, etc.). For
#' example, R-squared is no longer guaranteed to lie within the [0,1] interval
#' or to uniformly increase as more predictors are added. Most importantly, the
#' interpretation of R-squared as the fraction of uncertainty explained by the
#' model does not generally hold for exponential family regression models.
#'
#' Cameron and Windmeijer (1997) proposed an R-squared measure (termed
#' \eqn{R_{KL}^2}) for GLMs based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
#' (\eqn{entropy -  cross-entropy}), which restores all of the desirable
#' properties of R-squared, including its interpretation as the fraction of
#' uncertainty explained. Owing to an equivalence between KL-divergence and
#' deviance, others have referred to this metric as \eqn{R_D^2} (Martin & Hall,
#' 2016), or deviance explained. It is defined as \eqn{1-dev/nulldev}, where
#' \eqn{dev} is the deviance: \eqn{2*(loglik_sat - loglik_fit)}, where
#' \eqn{loglik_sat} is the log-likelihood for the saturated model (a model
#' with 1 free parameter per observation) and \eqn{loglik_fit} is the log-
#' likelihood for the fitted model; and where \eqn{nulldev} is the null
#' deviance: \eqn{2*(loglik_sat - loglik_null)}, where \eqn{loglik_null} is the
#' log-likelihood for the intercept-only model. Following the reasoning of
#' Martin & Hall (2016), the saturated and null models for zero-inflated (ZI)
#' regression are equivalent to the saturated and null models for the
#' corresponding non-ZI regression: e.g., the saturated model for Poisson
#' regression defines the saturated model for ZI-Poisson regression.
