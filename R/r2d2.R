#' Proportion of variance and deviance explained
#'
#' Returns the fraction of variance explained and the fraction of deviance
#' explained by a fitted model object.
#'
#' For standard linear regression models fit with \code{\link[stats]{lm}}, the
#' familiar coefficient of determination, R-squared, can be obtained with
#' \code{\link[stats]{summary.lm}}. However, R-squared is not provided for
#' generalized linear models (GLMs) fit with \code{\link[stats]{glm}},
#' presumably because it can have undesirable properties when applied to GLMs
#' if the error distribution is non-normal (e.g., binomial, Poisson, etc.).
#' For example, it can lie outside the [0,1] interval and decrease as predictors
#' are added. Most importantly, the interpretation of R-squared as the fraction
#' of uncertainty explained by the model does not generally hold for exponential
#' family regression models.
#'
#' Cameron and Windmeijer (1997) proposed an R-squared measure for GLMs based on
#' Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (\eqn{entropy -  cross-entropy}), which they
#' termed \eqn{R_{KL}^2}, that restores all of the desirable properties of
#' R-squared, including its interpretation as the fraction of uncertainty
#' explained. Owing to an equivalence between KL-divergence and deviance, others
#' have referred to as \eqn{R_D^2} (Martin & Hall, 2016), \eqn{D^2}
#' (\code{\link[modEvA]{Dsquared}}), or \code{dev.ratio}
#' (\code{\link[glmnet]{glmnet}}). (\code{r2d2} adopts the latter terminology,
#' and the \code{\link{summary.beset_glm}} and
#' \code{\link{summary.beset_zeroinfl}} methods refer to this measure as
#' "Deviance Explained".
#'
#' The \code{dev_ratio} is defined to be \eqn{1-dev/nulldev}, where \eqn{dev} is
#' the deviance: \eqn{2*(loglik_sat - loglik_fit)}, where \eqn{loglik_sat} is
#' the log-likelihood for the saturated model (a model witha free parameter per
#' observation) and \eqn{loglik_fit} is the log-likelihood for the fitted model;
#' and where \eqn{nulldev} is the null deviance:
#' \eqn{2*(loglik_sat - loglik_null)}, where \eqn{loglik_null} is the
#' log-likelihood for the intercept-only model.
#'
#' @return \code{r2d2} returns a list with both variance explained (named
#' \code{"r_squared"}) and deviance explained (named \code{"dev_ratio"}) for
#' GLMs and zero-inflated models. For GLMs with a normal error distribution, the
#' two are equivalent. For all other GLMs, the deviance explained provides
#' the more meaningful measure of model fit.
