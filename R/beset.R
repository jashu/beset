#' beset: Best Subset Predictive Modeling
#'
#' \code{beset} is a portmanteau of BEst subSET, which is the common thread
#' underlying the functions in this package: to explore large multivariate data
#' sets and extract useful features from spaces where many, if not most, of the
#' features are expected to be redundant or irrelevant. \code{beset} brings
#' together predictive modeling methods from other packages that perform
#' variable selection either explicitly (e.g., best subset selection) or
#' implicitly (e.g., lasso regression) as a part of model fitting.}
