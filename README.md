# beset: Best Subset Predictive Modeling

`beset` is a portmanteau of BEst subSET, which is the common thread connecting the functions in this package: to explore large multivariate data sets and mine useful features from high-dimensional spaces where many, if not most, of the features are expected to be redundant or irrelevant. `beset` brings together predictive modeling methods from other packages that perform variable selection either explicitly (e.g., best subset selection) or implicitly (e.g., lasso regression) as a part of model fitting.

## Installation instructions

To install `beset` in R, you first need to install the `devtools` package if you havenâ€™t already:

```
	install.packages("devtools")
```

Once `devtools` is installed, use the following command to install `beset` on your system:
```
	devtools::install_github("jashu/beset")
```
