\title{R-squared as Deviance Explained}
\usage{
r2d(object, newdata = NULL, cv = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Fitted model}

\item{newdata}{An optional data frame in which to look for variables with
which to calculate a predictive R-squared}

\item{cv}{A switch indicating if a predictive R-squared should be estimated
by cross-validation via a call to \code{\link{cv_r2}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link{cv_r2}}.}
}
\value{
Object of class "R2" with the following items:
\enumerate{
 \item\describe{
  \item{R2fit}{an R-squared statistic for the model fit}}
 \item\describe{
  \item{R2new}{if \code{newdata} was provided, an R-squared
  statistic for how well the model predicts new data}}
 \item\describe{
  \item{R2cv}{if \code{cv = TRUE}, an object returned by \code{\link{cv_r2}}}
  }}
}
\description{
\code{r2d} calculates R-squared as the fraction of deviance explained, which
equals traditional R-squared (fraction of variance explained) for linear
regression models, but, unlike traditional R-squared, generalizes to
exponential family regression models. With optional additional arguments,
\code{r2d} can also returns a predictive R-squared for how well the model
predicts responses for new observations and/or a cross-validated R-squared
with a bootstrapped confidence interval.

\details{
For standard linear regression models fit with \code{\link[stats]{lm}}, the
familiar coefficient of determination, R-squared, can be obtained with
\code{\link[stats]{summary.lm}}. However, R-squared is not provided for
generalized linear models (GLMs) fit with \code{\link[stats]{glm}},
presumably because it can have undesirable properties when applied to GLMs
with non-normal error distributions (e.g., binomial, Poisson, etc.). For
example, R-squared is no longer guaranteed to lie within the [0,1] interval
or to uniformly increase as more predictors are added. Most importantly, the
interpretation of R-squared as the fraction of uncertainty explained by the
model does not generally hold for exponential family regression models.

Cameron and Windmeijer (1997) proposed an R-squared measure (termed
\eqn{R_{KL}^2}) for GLMs based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
(\eqn{entropy -  cross-entropy}), which restores all of the desirable
properties of R-squared, including its interpretation as the fraction of
uncertainty explained. Owing to an equivalence between KL-divergence and
deviance, others have referred to this metric as \eqn{R_D^2} (Martin & Hall,
2016), or deviance explained. It is defined as \eqn{1-dev/nulldev}, where
\eqn{dev} is the deviance: \eqn{2*(loglik_sat - loglik_fit)}, where
\eqn{loglik_sat} is the log-likelihood for the saturated model (a model
with 1 free parameter per observation) and \eqn{loglik_fit} is the log-
likelihood for the fitted model; and where \eqn{nulldev} is the null
deviance: \eqn{2*(loglik_sat - loglik_null)}, where \eqn{loglik_null} is the
log-likelihood for the intercept-only model. Following the reasoning of
Martin & Hall (2016), the saturated and null models for zero-inflated (ZI)
regression are equivalent to the saturated and null models for the
corresponding non-ZI regression: e.g., the saturated model for Poisson
regression defines the saturated model for ZI-Poisson regression.
