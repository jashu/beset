\title{Proportion of variance and deviance explained}
\usage{
r2d2(x, ...)
}
\value{
\code{r2d2} returns a list with both variance explained (named
\code{"r_squared"}) and deviance explained (named \code{"dev_ratio"}) for
GLMs and zero-inflated models. For GLMs with a normal error distribution, the
two are equivalent. For all other GLMs, the deviance explained will provide
the more meaningful measure of model fit.
}
\description{
Returns the fraction of variance explained and the fraction of deviance
explained by a fitted model object.

\details{
For standard linear regression models fit with \code{\link[stats]{lm}}, the
familiar coefficient of determination, R-squared, can be obtained with
\code{\link[stats]{summary.lm}}. However, R-squared is not provided for
generalized linear models (GLMs) fit with \code{\link[stats]{glm}},
presumably because it can have undesirable properties when applied to GLMs
if the error distribution is non-normal (e.g., binomial, Poisson, etc.).
For example, it can lie outside the [0,1] interval and decrease as predictors
are added. Most importantly, the interpretation of R-squared as the fraction
of uncertainty explained by the model does not generally hold for exponential
family regression models.

Cameron and Windmeijer (1997) proposed an R-squared measure for GLMs based on
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (\eqn{entropy -  cross-entropy}), which they
termed \eqn{R_{KL}^2}, that restores all of the desirable properties of
R-squared, including its interpretation as the fraction of uncertainty
explained. Owing to an equivalence between KL-divergence and deviance, others
have referred to as \eqn{R_D^2} (Martin & Hall, 2016), \eqn{D^2}
(\code{\link[modEvA]{Dsquared}}), or \code{dev.ratio}
(\code{\link[glmnet]{glmnet}}). (\code{r2d2} adopts the latter terminology,
and the \code{\link{summary.beset_glm}} and
\code{\link{summary.beset_zeroinfl}} methods refer to this measure as
"Deviance Explained".

The \code{dev_ratio} is defined to be \eqn{1-dev/nulldev}, where \eqn{dev} is
the deviance: \eqn{2*(loglik_sat - loglik_fit)}, where \eqn{loglik_sat} is
the log-likelihood for the saturated model (a model witha free parameter per
observation) and \eqn{loglik_fit} is the log-likelihood for the fitted model;
and where \eqn{nulldev} is the null deviance:
\eqn{2*(loglik_sat - loglik_null)}, where \eqn{loglik_null} is the
log-likelihood for the intercept-only model.
